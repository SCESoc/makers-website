<h1>Showcase Your Project</h1>
<p>
	This website is a way for you to showcase projects you work on to the Carleton Community. The goal
	of the Project Showcase section is to surface projects that are being worked on in the community.
	This is a great way to show off your work to the community and to get feedback from other makers.
	We hope that this website will act as a platform to discover projects, collaborate, and share
	experiences among the Carleton Community
</p>

	Anyone in Carleton University can add projects to this website. There are 3 ways you can add a
